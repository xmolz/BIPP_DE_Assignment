Purpose: This project is part of a technical assessment at BIPP, Indian School of Business. The goal is to demonstrate the understanding and usage of decorators in Python.

## Overview

This script showcases two decorators:
1. `timing_decorator`: Measures the execution time of a function.
2. `caching_decorator`: Stores and reuses the results of a function.

The script also includes a `sum_integers` function that calculates the sum of a list of integers. This function is decorated with both the `timing_decorator` and the `caching_decorator`.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute it using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python decorator_assignment.py
