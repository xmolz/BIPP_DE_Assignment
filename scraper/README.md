This folder contains two Python scripts for downloading and consolidating data from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) website:

- `download_data.py`: Downloads state-wise data for different schemes and seasons from the PMFBY dashboard and saves it as separate CSV files.
- `consolidate_data.py`: Reads the downloaded CSV files, concatenates them into a single DataFrame, and saves it as a cleaned CSV file.

## Usage

### Downloading Data

To download the state-wise data, run the `download_data.py` script as follows:

```python
python download_data.py
```

This script will fetch data for different schemes and seasons from the PMFBY dashboard and save it as separate CSV files in the `raw data` folder.

### Consolidating Data

To consolidate the downloaded data into a single DataFrame, run the `consolidate_data.py` script as follows:

```python
python consolidate_data.py
```

This script will read the CSV files from the `raw data` folder, concatenate them into a single DataFrame, clean the column names, drop unnecessary columns, and save the consolidated DataFrame as a cleaned CSV file in the `cleaned data` folder.

## Dependencies

Both scripts require the following Python packages to be installed:

- requests
- pandas
- os
- re

You can install them using the following command:

```python
pip install requests pandas os re
```

## Outputs

The outputs generated by the scripts can be viewed in the following Google Drive folder:

The `raw data` folder contains the state-wise data downloaded by the `download_data.py` script, while the `cleaned data` folder contains the consolidated and cleaned data generated by the `consolidate_data.py` script.
